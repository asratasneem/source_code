# **Streamlining RNA-seq Data Analysis Using Clustering Pipelines**

This repository provides code, results, and documentation for a comparative study on clustering pipelines applied to bulk RNA-seq data. By integrating dimensionality reduction techniques with clustering algorithms, the study offers insights into transcriptomic patterns in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.

## **Project Summary**

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides transformative insights into transcriptomic changes, but analyzing high-dimensional RNA-seq data is computationally challenging. In this project, we compare four clustering pipelines to assess their performance in grouping RNA-seq data and their ability to uncover biologically meaningful insights. The best-performing pipeline was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, shedding light on molecular mechanisms of COVID-19.

## **Key Objectives**

1. Evaluate clustering pipelines combining dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) with clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering).
2. Identify biologically significant clusters associated with disease states.
3. Perform differential expression analysis (DEA) and pathway enrichment for actionable insights.

- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):** Measures agreement with true labels.
  - **Silhouette Score:** Reflects cluster separation.

### **4. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)**
- Identify significant DEGs between clusters.
- Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment.

## **Results**

## **Clustering Pipelines**

### **Pipeline 1: PCA + K-means Clustering**
- **Description:** 
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality by capturing global variance trends in the dataset.
  - K-means clustering grouped samples into 3 clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.
  - Applied PCA to reduce high-dimensional data to 2 components while retaining maximum variance.
- **Implementation Highlights:**
  - Optimal cluster count determined using the elbow method.
  - PCA explained **21.2% of the variance in PC1** and **7.9% in PC2**.
- **Evaluation Results:**
  - **Runtime:** 103.07 seconds
  - **ARI:** 0.32
  - **Silhouette Score:** 0.10
  - **Memory usage:** 218.43 MB
- **Insights:**
  - Showed basic separation of healthy and COVID-19 states but limited biological interpretability.
